# Go Calendar
Ported CLI calendar project from college, from C to Go.

## Purpose
Learn more about Go through an involved project. \
Topics Explored:
- Variables
- Functions
- Pointers
- Tests
- Error handling
- Modules/Packages

## Future
I hope to expand this code as the backend for a web application. \

## PS
I've read somewhere that **Go's mascot is a gopher because := looks like a gopher's eyes and teeth**.
