# Go Calendar :=
Port of a CLI calendar written in C from college, in Go!

## Purpose
The idea behind this port is to learn more about Go by implementing a robust, involved application. \
Topics Explored:
- Variables
- Functions
- Pointers
- Tests
- Error handling
- Modules/Packages

## Future
I hope to expand this code as the backend for a web application. \
Ideally, I'd take this opportunity to learn a new frontend framework and database :=.

## PS
I've read somewhere that **Go's mascot is a gopher because := looks like a gopher's eyes and teeth**, which I choose to pretend is real, and therefore marvelous.
